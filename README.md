# Introduction to Java Programming, 10th Edition 
## Volume I - Fundamentals (Comprehensive Version)
###### by Y. Daniel Liang

**Description**

### Organization of the Book

The chapters can be grouped into five parts that, taken together, form a comprehensive introduction
to Java programming, data structures and algorithms, and database and Web programming.
Because knowledge is cumulative, the early chapters provide the conceptual basis for understanding
programming and guide students through simple examples and exercises; subsequent
chapters progressively present Java programming in detail, culminating with the development
of comprehensive Java applications. The appendixes contain a mixed bag of topics, including an
introduction to number systems, bitwise operations, regular expressions, and enumerated types.

#### Part I: Fundamentals of Programming (Chapters 1–8)

The first part of the book is a stepping stone, preparing you to embark on the journey of learning
Java. You will begin to learn about Java (Chapter 1) and fundamental programming techniques
with primitive data types, variables, constants, assignments, expressions, and operators (Chapter 2),
selection statements (Chapter 3), mathematical functions, characters, and strings (Chapter 4), loops
(Chapter 5), methods (Chapter 6), and arrays (Chapters 7–8). After Chapter 7, you can jump to
Chapter 18 to learn how to write recursive methods for solving inherently recursive problems.

#### Part II: Object-Oriented Programming (Chapters 9–13, and 17)

This part introduces object-oriented programming. Java is an object-oriented programming
language that uses abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to provide
great flexibility, modularity, and reusability in developing software. You will learn programming
with objects and classes (Chapters 9–10), class inheritance (Chapter 11), polymorphism
(Chapter 11), exception handling (Chapter 12), abstract classes (Chapter 13), and interfaces
(Chapter 13). Text I/O is introduced in Chapter 12 and binary I/O is discussed in Chapter 17.

Part III: GUI Programming (Chapters 14–16 and Bonus Chapter 34)

JavaFX is a new framework for developing Java GUI programs. It is not only useful for
developing GUI programs, but also an excellent pedagogical tool for learning object-oriented
programming. This part introduces Java GUI programming using JavaFX in Chapters 14–16.
Major topics include GUI basics (Chapter 14), container panes (Chapter 14), drawing shapes
(Chapter 14), event-driven programming (Chapter 15), animations (Chapter 15), and GUI
controls (Chapter 16), and playing audio and video (Chapter 16). You will learn the architecture
of JavaFX GUI programming and use the controls, shapes, panes, image, and video to
develop useful applications. Chapter 34 covers advanced features in JavaFX.

#### Part IV: Algorithms and Data Structures (Chapters 18–29 and Bonus Chapters 40–41)

This part covers the main subjects in a typical data structures and algorithms course. Chapter 18
introduces recursion to write methods for solving inherently recursive problems. Chapter 19
presents how generics can improve software reliability. Chapters 20 and 21 introduce the
Java Collection Framework, which defines a set of useful API for data structures. Chapter 22
discusses measuring algorithm efficiency in order to choose an appropriate algorithm for
applications. Chapter 23 describes classic sorting algorithms. You will learn how to implement
several classic data structures lists, queues, and priority queues in Chapter 24. Chapters 25 and
26 introduce binary search trees and AVL trees. Chapter 27 presents hashing and implementing
maps and sets using hashing. Chapters 28 and 29 introduce graph applications. The 2-4
trees, B-trees, and red-black trees are covered in Bonus Chapters 40–41.

#### Part V: Advanced Java Programming (Chapters 30–33 and Bonus Chapters 35–39, 42)

This part of the book is devoted to advanced Java programming. Chapter 30 treats the use
of multithreading to make programs more responsive and interactive and introduces parallel
programming. Chapter 31 discusses how to write programs that talk with each other from
different hosts over the Internet. Chapter 32 introduces the use of Java to develop database

projects. Chapter 33 introduces modern Web application development using JavaServer Faces.
Chapter 35 delves into advanced Java database programming. Chapter 36 covers the use of
internationalization support to develop projects for international audiences. Chapters 37 and
38 introduce how to use Java servlets and JavaServer Pages to generate dynamic content from
Web servers. Chapter 39 discusses Web services. Chapter 42 introduces testing Java programs
using JUnit.

#### Appendixes

This part of the book covers a mixed bag of topics. Appendix A lists Java keywords.
Appendix B gives tables of ASCII characters and their associated codes in decimal and in
hex. Appendix C shows the operator precedence. Appendix D summarizes Java modifiers and
their usage. Appendix E discusses special floating-point values. Appendix F introduces number
systems and conversions among binary, decimal, and hex numbers. Finally, Appendix G
introduces bitwise operations. Appendix H introduces regular expressions. Appendix I covers
enumerated types.
